      <h1 class="doc-recette-title">Beef Parmesan with Garlic Angel Hair Pasta</h1>
      <ul class="doc-recette-ingredient">
         <li>1.5 pounds of beef cube steak</li>
         <li>1 onion, sliced into thin rings</li>
         <li>1 green bell pepper, sliced in rings</li>
         <li>1 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
         <li>0.5 cup of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
         <li>1 jar of spaghetti sauce</li>
         <li>0.5 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
         <li>12 ounces of angel hair pasta</li>
         <li>2 teaspoons of minced garlic</li>
         <li>0.25 cup of butter</li>
      </ul>
      <ol class="doc-recette-preparation">
         <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      </li>
         <li>
        Cut cube steak into serving size pieces. Coat meat with the bread crumbs
        and parmesan cheese. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan, and saute 1
        teaspoon of the garlic for 3 minutes. Quick fry (brown quickly on both sides)
        meat. Place meat in a casserole baking dish, slightly overlapping edges.
        Place onion rings and peppers on top of meat, and pour marinara sauce
        over all.
      </li>
         <li>
        Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes, depending on
        the thickness of the meat. Sprinkle mozzarella over meat and leave in the
        oven till bubbly.
      </li>
         <li>
        Boil pasta al dente. Drain, and toss in butter and 1 teaspoon garlic. For a
        stronger garlic taste, season with garlic powder. Top with grated parmesan
        and parsley for color. Serve meat and sauce atop a mound of pasta!
