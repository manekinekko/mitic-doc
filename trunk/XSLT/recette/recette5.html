      <ul class="doc-recette-ingredient">
         <li>pastry<ul>
               <li>15 ounces of chilled unsalted butter</li>
               <li>3 cups of flour</li>
               <li>1.5 teaspoons of salt</li>
               <li>0.75 cup of ice water</li>
            </ul>
            <ol class="doc-recette-preparation">
               <li>
          In a large bowl, cut 6 tablespoons of the butter into the flour with 
          a pastry blender until the butter is more or less incorporated. Now 
          coarsely cut the remaining butter into the flour mixture, leaving many 
          visible pieces of butter (about 1/4 inch in diameter should be fine).
        </li>
               <li>
          Dissolve the salt into the ice water. Slowly drizzle the salted water 
          into the flour mixture while tossing gently with a fork. When all the water
          has been evenly distributed, there will remain many dry crumbs. Don't worry.
        </li>
               <li>
          Empty the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap. By folding up the 
          four sides of the wrap and pressing, form a rectangle of dough. Roll the
          dough out just a bit and fold the sides over the middle, forming a piece 
          one third the former size. Repeat, this time folding the top and bottom
          to the middle. The butter and flour will not yet be working in harmony, so 
          you will probably have to use the plastic wrap to aid you in the first
          few folds.
        </li>
               <li>
          Puff pastry requires a somewhat Calvinist submission of the will and a 
          confidence that layers will appear. Roll the dough out again and repeat the
          folding, lightly dusting with flour between every layer. Discard the plastic 
          wrap as soon as the dough holds together on its own.
        </li>
               <li>
          The dough will become progressively softer as you work on it, with an almost 
          springy texture. After 6 or 10 repetitions of the folding and rolling, cut the 
          dough into 18 equal pieces. Wrap each well in plastic wrap and let rest in the 
          refrigerator for at least 2 hours.

              Place the chicken legs and thighs in one baking dish, the chicken breasts

              Place the chicken parts in a large stockpot, cover with cold water

              When the liquid is relatively clear, add the carrots, celery, whole onion,

            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Skim any fat off the stock and pour 
            enough over the marinated chicken to cover. Bake the chicken until it's 
            tender and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes for the breasts, a
            little longer for the legs and thighs.

            Reserve the juices from one of the baking dishes, skimming the fat off

            In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat and sprinkle in 
            the flour. Cook and stir until light brown. Add the reduced juices and
            cook until very thick. (This should yield about 1 1/2 cups.)

         <li>
        Cut the stack of phyllo sheets in half and lay between two damp, clean 
        towels. Lightly dust with flour and roll each of the 18 pieces of dough 
        to a diameter of 6 to 8 inches. Set aside.Place about 1/2 cup of the chicken 
        mixture into a half sheet of phyllo and wrap like an egg roll into a neat, 
        tight package. Place the phyllo-wrapped chicken on the rolled dough, and brush 
        the egg white around it.
      </li>
         <li>
        Fold the bottom of the dough up onto the phyllo to form the foot of the 
        coffin. Then fold up the sides and top of the dough, pinching it together 
        to make a cross shape on the top. Repeat for each sarcophage. Cover and
        chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
      </li>
         <li>
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Brush the pastry with egg white and bake 
        for 15 minutes, or till golden brown. 18 servings.
